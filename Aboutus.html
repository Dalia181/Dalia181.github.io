<h2> About this little cafe!</h2>
<p> 
Welcome to This Little Café, your go-to spot for great coffee and fresh baked goods! We’re proud to serve locally roasted beans from Velvet Sunrise Coffee Roasters and treats from Batter’s Up Custom Cakes. After a long-awaited reopening inside the Magna Centre, we’re back with a new look and local favourites. Owned by Robin and Jason Groves since 2010, we’re here to serve our community, one cup at a time!
