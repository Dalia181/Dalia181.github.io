<h2>Whats a div tag?</h2>
  <p>The div element is a like
bucket that groups sections
of a webpage together.
All div elements you call
in your CSS will be impacted
by the styling you apply to
it. If you want to target a
div individually,you need a
way to identify them.</p>
    <h2> Whats one way to identify a div element</h2>
    <p>A div can be identified or
“targeted” in several
different ways. For today, we
are going to focus on classes.
When you are calling a class
in CSS, it will target every
div with the same class.
You can repeat styling across
a website using the same class
without having to repeat the
CSS.To target a specific div,
call the class. All div
elements that share a class
will have the same styling.
The class is case sensitive
and there must be a period .
before it.

If you would like to target
specific elements in a
div, call it in the CSS.</p>
    <h2> Why use div?</h2>
    <p>You'll primarily use the div tag to group similar content together so you can style it easily</p>
    <h2>whats a border property</h2>
    <p>The border property allows you
to style the border around an
element.
The border indicates the size
of an element.
      
    </p>

    <h2> What are the different boarder properties</h2>
<p>Borders

Border width

Border color

Border sides

Rounded borders</p>
    <h2> Differences between margins and padding?</h2>
    <p>Think of padding as someone
wearing a big coat, and the
margin as the space people give them.</p>
